Humana-Mays Healthcare Analytics Case Competition 2022


Welcome to the Humana-Mays Healthcare Analytics Case Competition 2022 project! In this project, we built a powerful Gradient Boosting Classifier on a large dataset provided by Humana, consisting of over 50,000 rows and 800 features. Our goal was to predict which members were most likely to be experiencing housing insecurity. Through extensive data analysis, feature engineering, and model optimization, we achieved an impressive AUC score of 0.76, along with other high-performance metrics. Our team's hard work and dedication resulted in us ranking in the top 10 of all teams nationwide. This project showcases our expertise in healthcare analytics and demonstrates our ability to tackle complex real-world problems using machine learning techniques. We are proud to share our findings and insights with the community, and we hope that our work contributes to the advancement of healthcare analytics and the understanding of housing insecurity among members.
